## Predict Number of Orders for a Product with Machine Learning
Predicting the number of orders for a product is one of the strategies a business can follow in determining how much to invest in marketing their product. So, predicting the number of orders is an important data science use case for product-based companies. In this article, I will walk you through the task of the number of orders prediction with machine learning using Python.

If we want to predict the number of orders a company may receive for a particular product, then we need to have historical data about the number of orders received by the company. So for this task, I will be using the sales data of supplements that have been collected from Kaggle. The data that I will be using for the task of the number of orders prediction contains data about:

1. Product ID
2. Store ID
3. The type of store where the supplement was sold
4. The type of location the order was received from
5. Sales Date
6. Region code
7. Whether it is a public holiday or not at the time of order
8. Whether the product was on discount or not
9. Number of orders placed
10. Sales
